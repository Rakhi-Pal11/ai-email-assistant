                                              AI Email Assistant
The AI Email Assistant is a project designed to make email management easier and faster. It connects with Gmail using Google OAuth and the Gmail API to fetch emails in real time. The backend is built with FastAPI and handles authentication and email retrieval, while the frontend is created using HTML, Bootstrap, and Chart.js to provide a clean dashboard where users can log in, view their inbox, and see useful statistics such as sentiment and priority of messages. The system aims to reduce manual effort by providing insights into incoming emails and helping organizations respond more effectively. To use the project, you need to clone the repository, install the required Python dependencies, configure Google OAuth by adding a client_secret.json file in the backend folder, run the FastAPI server, and open the frontend in a browser. Future improvements could include automatic replies for urgent emails, smarter categorization, and more advanced analytics. The project is open-source under the MIT License and can be freely used or modified.
